The software gathers and processes all the data needed to manage temporary use authorizations (ATU), temporary use recommendation (RTU), post-authorization security study (PASS), and actual data. The objective is to allow a qualitative collection and to obtain a better quality in the analysis of the data which are not collected or little collected and analyzed today. The interfaces are adapted to the different types of ATU, RTU and PASS requirements, including the ability to manage and manage independently. Including an interface of exchange between the interlocutors involved in the same project. Ultimately, the full use of this software should allow cross-analysis of real-life data and study data to demonstrate the correlation between patient behaviors and treatment success.
